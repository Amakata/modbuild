# Magento Package XML Builder for Modman

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/punkstar/modbuild.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/punkstar/modbuild)

I use [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) to manage any Magento Extensions that I write.  An extension must be packaged once it's complete.  I don't enjoy using the "Package Magento Extension" interface in the Magento admin, nor do I like writing the XML by hand.

This script gives you a running start by generating an XML file that you can then load in the admin interface containing most of the information you'll need, such as all of the files included in the extension and any metadata that you've included in your modman file.

### Example modman File

You can include basic information, such as extension name, version, summary and description, in your modman file to be included in the generated XML file.  For example:

    # Name: Meanbee_Topsecret
    # Version: 1.0.0
    # Description: This is a topsecret module, and no-one must know about it.
    # Summary: I'm not telling.
    
    app/etc/modules/Meanbee_Topsecret.xml app/etc/modules/

### Example Usage

If I had a Magento installation in `~/Sites/meanbee/module_topsecret/`, and a modman compatible repoistory checked out in `~/Sites/meanbee/module_topsecreet/.modman/topsecret`, then I would run the following to generate an almost complete package file in `var/connect`:

    modbuild ~/Sites/meanbee/module_topsecreet/.modman/topsecret > ~/Sites/meanbee/module_topsecret/var/connect/Meanbee_Topsecret.xml
